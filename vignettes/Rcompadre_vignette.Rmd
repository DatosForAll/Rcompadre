# Workshop materials on the COMADRE and COMPADRE matrix databases.

These databases together contain several thousand (mostly) published matrix population models (MPMs) for species from across the diverse tree of life.

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to the databases and explain their structure and how one can use them to obtain MPMs from particular species of interest, and groups of species for comparative demographic analyses.

## What the workshop material covers

- Introduction - what are COMADRE and COMPADRE?
- Structure of the database
- What metadata are included?
- Querying the database
- Conducting some large-scale comparative analysis

The suggested order that you tackle these worksheets is:

1. Obtaining_An_MPM.pdf
2. PlotALifeCycleDiagram.pdf
3. SimpleOutputs.pdf
4. GeographicDistribution.pdf
5. TernaryPlots.pdf
6. AgeFromStage.pdf
7. ObtainingReferences.pdf
8. CheckingTaxonomy.pdf

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
