\title{The 'matrixClassAuthor' and 'stageNames' functions extract the matrixClassAuthor column from 
the matrixClass data frame from a CompadreMat or CompadreDB object. 
For CompadreMat objects, this is a single character vector, for CompadreDB objects 
this is a list of character vectors. The matrixClassAuthor data
describes the names of the stages as determined by the author of the original
